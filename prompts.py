The diagram you generate will be added to a Google Doc along with the same proposal. The diagram's purpose is to help a non-technical stakeholder quickly understand the core stages and flow. It should be a tool for clarity.

**Guiding Principles**:
- Identify the Core Flow: Look for the main sequence of events. 
- Focus on Structure, Not Details: Avoid getting lost in minor technical details. If a step involves "scraping, cleaning, and parsing," that can often be represented as a single node like "Data Collection & Preparation" (if there are other nodes that will take up space). The goal is a high-level overview.
- Group Logically: Use subgraph to group related steps into distinct phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Data Setup," "Phase 2: Model Development," "Phase 3: Deployment"). This is the best way to make a complex plan easy to follow.
- Use Clear & Concise Language: Node labels should be short and understandable. Use <br/> to break longer lines for better readability.

Your process should be:
- Read the user's proposal carefully.
- Synthesize the key stages of the plan.
- Write the complete and valid Mermaid `graph TD` code that represents this plan.

Proposal 1:

Custom Legal AI Research & Drafting Assistant

Hello! As mentioned, I’m so confident I’m the right fit for this I went ahead and created a proposal for you, including a step-by-step of how I’d do it.

I’ve done the below many times and working with **custom legal document ingestion and generation** is actually one of my favorite parts of generative AI work. I have extensive experience building the exact kind of secure, high-precision RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system you've described.

**Anyway**, here’s how I’d build it:

[MERMAID_DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER]

- **1. Foundation & Secure Data Ingestion:** First, we'll set up the secure foundation for the system. I'll build a data ingestion pipeline that takes your legal documents (IRS rulings, regs, etc.), intelligently parses and chunks them (respecting document structure like sections and paragraphs), and uses OpenAI's state-of-the-art models to create vector embeddings. These will be stored in a local and secure vector database like Chroma or FAISS, ensuring your sensitive data never leaves your control.

- **2. Prioritized Retrieval (The "Firm's Position" Logic):** This is the key to making the assistant truly *yours*. We'll create two distinct, logically separated collections within the vector store: one for the public corpus of legal documents and a second, prioritized one for your private memos and custom legal interpretations. When a query is made, the system will be hard-coded to search your private interpretations *first*. This ensures that if you have a specific stance on a topic, the AI adopts it as the primary source of truth before consulting public documents.

- **3. High-Precision Q&A Chatbot:** I'll develop the web interface using Streamlit, which is perfect for rapid, interactive tool development. When you ask a question (e.g., *“Does this contract comply with Rev. Proc. 2017-13?”*), the system will:
    - a) Query the vector stores to retrieve the most relevant text chunks (from your memos first, then public docs).
    - b) Feed these chunks as context to a GPT-4o model with a specialized prompt.
    - c) This prompt will strictly command the model to answer *only* using the provided text, and critically, to embed direct quotes and cite the source document for every part of its answer.

- **4. Dynamic Word Document Generation:** For drafting tasks (e.g., *“Draft a tax certificate for a recycling facility..."*), the workflow will be seamless. You'll input the key facts and select a document template you've uploaded. The system will then use GPT-4o to analyze the facts, retrieve any necessary legal context from the knowledge base, and intelligently populate the placeholders in the template. Using the `python-docx` library, it will generate a fully-formatted Microsoft Word document, ready for your review and download.

- **5. Admin Control & Maintenance:** You will have a simple, secure admin page to manage the AI's knowledge base. Here, you can easily upload new documents, delete outdated ones, and trigger a complete re-indexing of the database with a single click, ensuring the assistant's information is always current.

So basically, **User Query/Facts → Intelligent Retrieval (Prioritizing Your Memos) → GPT-4o Synthesis & Citation → Formatted Answer or Generated Word Document**.

As for your question, I would be handling this project solo, ensuring a single point of contact and a cohesive vision from start to finish.

**A little about me**:
I'm a generative AI engineer who builds intelligent multi-agent systems, LangChain/LangGraph workflows, RAG systems, and AI-powered tools for real-world impact.

Relevant projects I've recently done:

- **AI document information extraction & summarization pipeline** for a multinational glass manufacturer, saving ~$45,000/year by processing thousands of technical documents.

- **AI recruiter automation pipeline** that analyzed batches of CVs against complex, user-defined evaluation metrics, demonstrating expertise in custom document analysis.

- **AI Market Researcher agent** that scrapes competitor sites, clusters customer pain points from unstructured text, and writes data-backed reports; saved ≈ $25k in research fees.

- **AI network engineer using LangChain**, projected to save a major telecom company $200,000+ annually by autonomously troubleshooting networks with over 5,000 custom API tools.

To be upfront: my goal is to ideally work with you long-term, since I find it aligns incentives and lets me help clients better. So I'd treat everything we do together as foundational, and help you build systems that drive revenue/maximize cost savings.

I am really confident I can blow this out of the park for you, so if this sounds like something you're into, just respond to my proposal on Upwork & we'll take it from there.

# Proposal: Building Your SEO Content Domination Agent

Hello! As mentioned, I’m so confident I’m the right fit for this I went ahead and created a proposal for you, including a step-by-step of how I’d do it.

I’ve done the below many times and working with multi-step AI content workflows is actually one of my favorite parts of generative AI work.

**Anyway**, here’s how I’d build your SEO agent in N8N:

[MERMAID_DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER]

- **Step 1: Web Ingestion & Looping:** We'll start with an N8N node to ingest a list of target URLs. This will trigger a loop, processing each URL one by one for scalable content creation.

- **Step 2: Content Extraction & Cleaning:** For each URL, a Web Scraper node will pull the raw HTML. I'll then use a custom Python/JS Code node to parse this data (using libraries like BeautifulSoup) to extract only the clean, relevant text, stripping out ads, navigation, and boilerplate.

- **Step 3: Multi-Step AI Generation:** This is the core of the agent. We'll chain several OpenAI nodes with carefully engineered prompts:
    - **Summarization:** The first call will distill the cleaned text into core ideas and key takeaways.
    - **SEO Copywriting:** The second call will take this summary and a set of target keywords to generate a new, optimized piece of content.
    - **Humanization:** A final call will refine the copy, adjusting its tone, style, and flow to ensure it reads naturally and isn't obviously AI-generated.

- **Step 4: Output Management:** The final, humanized text will be passed to a Google Drive node, which will create a new Google Doc and save the content, neatly organized by the source URL or topic.

So basically, **URL Ingestion -> Content Extraction & Cleaning -> Multi-Step AI Content Generation -> Final Output to Google Drive**.

**A little about me**:
I'm a generative AI engineer who builds intelligent multi-agent systems, LangChain/LangGraph workflows, RAG systems, and AI-powered tools for real-world impact. Answering your questions directly:

- **Tools & Libraries:** While I'm proficient with N8N's logic, my core expertise is in code-first frameworks like **LangChain and LangGraph**, using **Python**. This means if we ever hit the limits of a low-code tool, I can build a more robust, custom solution using the OpenAI API, FastAPI, and various data processing libraries directly. I'm also highly experienced with the Google Workspace APIs.

- **Availability:** I have immediate availability for ongoing work and can dedicate the necessary hours to drive your projects forward successfully.

Relevant projects I've recently done (which serve as examples of my AI automation work):

- **AI Market Researcher Agent:** This is very similar to your SEO agent. It scrapes competitor websites, uses AI to cluster customer pain points and feature requests, and then writes comprehensive, data-backed reports. It effectively automated a complex research and content generation workflow, saving my client ~$25k in research fees.

- **AI Document Information Extraction & Summarization Pipeline:** I built a system for a multinational manufacturer that processes thousands of technical documents, extracts key information, and generates concise summaries, saving the team an estimated $45,000/year.

- **AI Network Engineer Agent:** This complex multi-agent system uses over 5,000 custom tools to autonomously troubleshoot enterprise networks. This project showcases my ability to build sophisticated, reliable automation systems for mission-critical tasks and is a top 12 finalist in the T-Mobile T Challenge.

To be upfront: my goal is to ideally work with you long-term, since I find it aligns incentives and lets me help clients better. So I'd treat everything we do together as foundational, and help you build systems that drive revenue/maximize cost savings.

# AI Agent System for Supply Chain Prospecting & Outreach

Hello! As mentioned, I’m so confident I’m the right fit for this I went ahead and created a proposal for you, including a step-by-step of how I’d do it.

I’ve done the below many times and working with multi-step agentic workflows that cross-reference live data to generate personalized outreach is actually one of my favorite parts of generative AI work. Your detailed process map means we can hit the ground running and focus purely on robust implementation.

**Anyway**, here’s how I’d build it:

[MERMAID_DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER]

- **Step 1: Data Ingestion & RAG Foundation.** First, I'll set up a daily automated agent to query Google News for U.S. supply chain disruptions. A subsequent LLM-powered pipeline will then extract and structure key data points (headlines, summaries, impacted sectors) and embed them into a Relevance AI knowledge base, creating a powerful foundation for the rest of the workflow.

- **Step 2: Daily Intelligence Briefing.** Next, I'll configure a separate agent to query this knowledge base daily. It will identify the top 3–5 most critical news events based on your logic, and compile them into a clean, well-formatted HTML email report that gets sent to you automatically.

- **Step 3: Automated Prospect Identification.** The core agent will then take the impacted companies and sectors from the news, interface with the LinkedIn API to identify relevant decision-makers within those companies, and generate a target list of 14 new contacts per day.

- **Step 4: Personalized Outreach Generation.** Using the specific news context (the "why them, why now") and the contact's LinkedIn profile data, a specialized "Personalization Agent" will draft a unique, compelling connection message based on the template logic you've already designed.

- **Step 5: Human-in-the-Loop Approval.** To ensure you have full control, all generated messages will be routed directly to you via an Outlook/email integration. This creates a simple but crucial approval gate, allowing you to review and sign off on every message before it's sent.

- **Step 6: Execution.** Directly sending LinkedIn messages via code is not a feature of their API and trying that violates their User Agreement, unless you are an official “Communications (Messages) API” partner of Upwork. Alternatively, what we can do is you’ll be emailed a list of the 14 contacts’ LinkedIn URLs and their tailored message. You just open the link and paste the message. If you require more automation on this part, I can work on trying to use Phantombuster or Puppeteer to automate browser behavior to send the message, but that can be risky.

So basically, **Google News Scraping -> LLM Data Structuring -> Knowledge Base Population -> Daily Email Briefing -> LinkedIn Prospecting -> Personalized Message Generation -> Client Approval via Email**.

**A little about me**:
I'm a generative AI engineer who builds intelligent multi-agent systems, LangChain/LangGraph workflows, RAG systems, and AI-powered tools for real-world impact.

Relevant projects I've recently done:

- **AI Market Researcher Agent:** I built an agent that scrapes competitor websites, uses LLMs to cluster customer pain points, and writes data-backed reports. This is directly analogous to your need to scrape Google News, structure the data, and generate a daily briefing.

- **AI Network Engineer Agent:** I developed a complex multi-agent system using LangChain with over 5,000 custom API tools to autonomously troubleshoot enterprise networks. This project showcases my deep experience in orchestrating complex workflows and integrating multiple external APIs, just as this project requires for Google News, LinkedIn, Outlook, and Pipedrive.

- **AI Document Information Extraction Pipeline:** I built a system for a multinational manufacturer that processes complex technical documents to extract and summarize critical information, saving them ~$45,000/year. This highlights my ability to build reliable data extraction pipelines, which is the core of your project's first step.

To be upfront: my goal is to ideally work with you long-term, since I find it aligns incentives and lets me help clients better. So I'd treat everything we do together as foundational, and help you build systems that drive revenue/maximize cost savings.

I am really confident I can blow this out of the park for you, so if this sounds like something you're into, just respond to my proposal on Upwork & we'll take it from there.

# AI-Powered Quant R&D Pipeline

Hello! As mentioned, I’m so confident I’m the right fit for this I went ahead and created a proposal for you, including a step-by-step of how I’d do it.

I’ve done the below many times and working with intelligent multi-agent systems for autonomous research is actually one of my favorite parts of generative AI work.

**Anyway**, here’s how I’d build it:

[MERMAID_DIAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER]

- **Step 1: Strategic Briefing & Decomposition.** The system starts when you (the founder) provide a high-level strategic prompt (e.g., "Explore momentum strategies for US tech stocks using social media sentiment as a factor"). A `Master Coordinator Agent` (built using a framework like LangGraph for state management) parses this brief and breaks it down into a logical, multi-stage research plan.

- **Step 2: Autonomous Data Sourcing.** The Coordinator dispatches a `Data Sourcing Agent`. This agent identifies and retrieves all necessary data: historical market data (price, volume) from financial APIs, fundamental data, and alternative data like the requested social media sentiment scores via web scraping or news APIs.

- **Step 3: Intelligent Feature Engineering.** A `Feature Engineering Agent` receives the raw data. It autonomously generates a wide range of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and custom features based on the initial prompt, such as sentiment momentum scores.

- **Step 4: Hypothesis & Model Generation.** A `Modeling Agent` takes the engineered features and formulates multiple trading strategy hypotheses. It can use various techniques, from rule-based logic to more complex ML models (like XGBoost or a simple neural net) to identify potential trading signals.

- **Step 5: Rigorous Backtesting & Analysis.** Each proposed strategy is passed to a `Backtesting Agent`. This agent uses a robust library (like Zipline or backtesting.py) to simulate the strategy's performance on historical data. It generates a full suite of risk and performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino, Max Drawdown, CAGR, etc.).

- **Step 6: Iterative Optimization & Human-in-the-Loop Review.** The system doesn't just stop. Based on backtesting results, the Coordinator can initiate new loops, directing the Feature Engineering and Modeling agents to refine their approaches. At key checkpoints (e.g., after a promising strategy with a Sharpe > 1.5 is found), the system pauses and presents a summary for your review and qualitative feedback.

- **Step 7: Code Generation & Final Briefing.** Once a strategy is approved, a `Code Generation Agent` translates the validated logic into multiple production-ready formats (e.g., Python for a Lean/QuantConnect environment, C++, and a plain English summary). A `Reporting Agent` then compiles all findings—the initial brief, data sources, methodology, backtest results, and final code—into a comprehensive final presentation.

So basically, **Founder's Brief → Autonomous R&D Cycle (Data -> Features -> Model -> Backtest) → Human Review Checkpoint → Final Strategy Package (Code & Report)**.

**A little about me**:
I'm a generative AI engineer who builds intelligent multi-agent systems, LangChain/LangGraph workflows, RAG systems, and AI-powered tools for real-world impact. My specialty is architecting autonomous systems that replicate and automate complex human workflows, which aligns perfectly with your goal of creating an AI-driven R&D pipeline.

Relevant projects I've recently done:

- **AI Network Engineer:** I designed and built a multi-agent system projected to save a major telecom company over $200,000 annually. It uses a master coordinator agent to dispatch tasks to thousands of specialized API tools to autonomously troubleshoot and resolve complex network issues. This project was a top 12 finalist in the T-Mobile T Challenge and demonstrates my ability to build the exact kind of coordinator/specialist agent architecture you require.

- **AI Market Researcher:** I created an autonomous agent that researches competitor websites, analyzes user reviews to find pain points, clusters the findings, and writes comprehensive, data-backed reports. This is directly analogous to the "research" and "briefing" components of your project.

- **AI Therapist using LangGraph:** I built a complex, stateful conversational agent using LangGraph. This is crucial because a quant R&D pipeline is not a simple linear chain; it requires cycles, state management, and iteration, which LangGraph is perfectly designed for. This showcases my ability to build the modular and extensible architecture you need.

- **AI Document Information Extraction:** Developed a pipeline for a multinational manufacturer to extract and summarize key information from dense technical documents, saving ~$45,000/year. This is relevant for having the system potentially ingest and learn from academic research papers on trading strategies.

To be upfront: my goal is to ideally work with you long-term, since I find it aligns incentives and lets me help clients better. So I'd treat everything we do together as foundational, and help you build systems that drive revenue/maximize cost savings.

I am really confident I can blow this out of the park for you, so if this sounds like something you're into, just respond to my proposal on Upwork & we'll take it from there.

--------------------

Notice how many diagrams will may be vertically long, and so we use the following to reduce the vertical white space: 
```
%%{init: {
   'flowchart': {
     'nodeSpacing': 50,
     'rankSpacing': 20
   },
   'themeVariables': {
     'fontSize': '16px'
   }
}}%%
```
This is because our diagram has to fit into a Google Doc eventually and needs to look nice. 
For other diagrams that are not too long vertically (like the 4th example), we don't need to add this spacing. 
Note also how when we have this reduced spacing, we have no phase headings or very short ones (because otherwise they get cut off by the shapes). 
If you feel the diagram is going to be long vertically and we should have this spacing, you should add it to the start of the output (but DO NOT add sub-graph headings then). 

**YOUR FINAL OUTPUT SHOULD JUST BE THE MERMAID DIAGRAM, STARTING LITERALLY WITH `graph TD` OR `%%{init: { ... }}%%` (WITHOUT ANY DELIMITERS ETC.).**
